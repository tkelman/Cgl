CUT GENERATION LIBRARY INSTALLATION
===================================

More information is available on the Cut Generation Library (Cgl)
Trac page at:

   https://projects.coin-or.org/Cgl

The instructions below are for UNIX-like systems (including Linux, Cygwin
and MSys) only.  If Microsoft Developer Studio projects are
maintained for this package, you can find instructions at

  https://projects.coin-or.org/MSVisualStudio


**********************************************************************
***                         DOWNLOAD                               ***
**********************************************************************

You can obtain the source code for the Cgl package in two ways:

1. Obtain the source directly from the COIN-OR subversion repository
   (recommended).  For this you needs the program 'svn' installed on
   your machine, and output of "svn --version" must contain 
   "handles 'https' scheme".

   Assuming that you want to download the code into a subdirectory
   "coin-Cgl", you type

   svn co https://projects.coin-or.org/svn/Cgl/trunk coin-Cgl

2. Download the tarball from http://www.coin-or.org/Tarballs/Cgl and
   extract it, for example, with

   gunzip Cgl_2006Jun07.tgz
   tar xvf Cgl_2006Jun07.tar

   (Here "2006Jun07" is of course replaced by the string in the
   tarball you downloaded.)

   To match the description in the remainder of this installation file,
   rename the directory "Cgl_2006Jun07" to "coin-Cgl" using

   mv Cgl_2006Jun07 coin-Cgl


More detailed download instructions can be found at

   https://projects.coin-or.org/BuildTools/wiki/user-download


**********************************************************************
***                        CONFIGURATION                           ***
**********************************************************************

Go into the directory coin-Cgl.  There, type

   ./configure

Note that you might have to specify additional options, in case you
don't want to use the default choices that configure makes (e.g.,
compilers).  Please visit

   https://projects.coin-or.org/BuildTools/wiki/user-configure

and the Cgl Trac page for more information.

If everything went fine, you will see at the end of the output

   "Main configuration of Cgl successful"


**********************************************************************
***                COMPILATION AND INSTALLATION                    ***
**********************************************************************

In the directory coin-Cgl:

1. Compile the code by typing

   make

2. To test if the code works, type (this is optional)

   make test

   The typical output of the test is available from the Cgl Trac page.

3. To install the code, type

   make install

   The executables are installed in coin-Cgl/bin, the libraries in
   coin-Cgl/lib and the header files in coin-Cgl/include.

More information on the compilation and installation can be found on 
the Cgl Trac page and at

   https://projects.coin-or.org/BuildTools/wiki/user-compile


**********************************************************************
***                     DOXYGEN DOCUMENTATION                      ***
**********************************************************************

If you have Doxygen available, you can build the html documentation 
by typing

   make doxydoc

in the directory coin-Cgl. Then open the file 

   coin-Cgl/doxydoc/html/index.html 

with a browser. Note that this creates the documentation for all the
projects in the Cgl package. If you prefer to generate the documentation 
only for a subset of these projects, you can edit the file 
  
   coin-Cgl/doxydoc/doxygen.conf 

to exclude directories (using the EXCLUDE variable, for example).

If Doxygen is not available, the Cgl html documentation is available at:

   http://www.coin-or.org/Doxygen/Cgl/index.html


**********************************************************************
***                     USING THE LIBRARIES                        ***
**********************************************************************

Now you can link your own code with the installed libraries.  You can
find examples in the

   coin-Cgl/Cgl/examples/

subdirectory, see also the information at

   https://projects.coin-or.org/BuildTools/wiki/user-examples
