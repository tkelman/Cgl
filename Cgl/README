CUT GENERATION LIBRARY README
=============================

Welcome to the COIN-OR Cut Generator Library (Cgl). Cgl is 
distributed under the Common Public License Version 1.0 and is freely 
redistributable. All source code and documentation is copyright 
by International Business Machines Corporation and others. 
This README file may be distributed freely.

The COIN-OR Cut Generation Library is a collection of cut 
generators that can be used with other COIN-OR projects that make 
use of cuts, such as, among others, the linear solver Clp or the 
mixed integer linear programming solvers Cbc or BCP. 

Each cut generator is in a separate directory with its own maintainer. 
Maintainer names are listed in the AUTHORS file in the Cgl directory. 
For more information, see the Cgl Trac page (see below).

INSTALLATION
============

If you have downloaded the package 

   https://projects.coin-or.org/svn/Cgl/trunk

in the local directory coin-Cgl, please see the INSTALL file in 
coin-Cgl for a guide to install this package. 

If you have obtained Cgl by downloading another package, Cgl should be 
installed as part of the installation of that package. See the INSTALL 
file in the main directory of the package.


DOCUMENTATION
=============

If you have Doxygen available, you can build the html documentation 
by typing

   make doxydoc

in the main directory of the package, say coin-Pkg. Then open the file 

   coin-Pkg/doxydoc/html/index.html 

with a browser. Note that this creates the documentation for all the
projects in the package. If you prefer to generate the documentation 
only for a subset of these projects, you can edit the file 
  
   coin-pkg/doxydoc/doxygen.conf 

to exclude directories (using the EXCLUDE variable, for example).

If Doxygen is not available, html documentation is available at:

   http://www.coin-or.org/Doxygen/
