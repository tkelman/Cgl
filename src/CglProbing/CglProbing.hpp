/*! \brief Probing Cut Generator

  CglProbing borrows a subset of probing ideas put into OSL about ten years
  ago and extends them.  The only known documentation is a copy of a talk
  handout - Robin Lougee and Lou Hafer have copies.

  For selected integer variables (probe variables, see #setMode), the effect
  of changing bounds to force them up or down to the next integer is
  investigated.  Changing a bound on the probe variable may in turn affect
  other variables (continuous as well as integer).  There are various
  possible results:
  <ol>
    <li>
    It is shown that the problem is infeasible or can be fathomed by bound
    in one or both directions. If one direction remains viable (monotone),
    we can generate one or more column cuts and continue probing.
    </li>
    <li>
    It can happen that x -> 0 implies y -> 1, or any of three similar
    implications. This can be captured in a disaggregation cut.
    </li>
    <li>
    If both ways are feasible, it can happen that x -> 0 implies y -> 1
    *and* x -> 1 implies y -> 1 (or similar; again, a column cut).  More
    common is that x -> 0 implies y -> 1 and x -> 1 implies y -> 0 (or
    similar). This can be captured in an implication cut.
    </li>
    <li>
    x -> 1 causes a constraint to become slack by some amount c.  We can
    tighten the constraint ax + .... <= b (where a may be zero) to
    (a+c)x + .... <= b. This is coefficient strengthening. During
    preprocessing, it can be done in place, altering the coefficient in the
    existing constraint.
    </li>
  </ol>

  \todo
  The reader will note that when an implication is discovered we could
  directly substitute x for y, or vice versa, during preprocessing. This is
  not done at present as there is no mechanism for returning the information.

  The generated cuts are inserted into an OsiCut object. Both row cuts and
  column cuts may be returned. When called as #generateCutsAndModify, the
  client can also retrieve vectors with tightened variable bounds.

  In all modes, user specified limits (number of variables probed, types of
  cuts generated, etc.) are (mostly) observed.
